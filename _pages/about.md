🚀 Software Engineer | Web Developer | Cloud Enthusiast.<br>
<br>

<p>Back in 2018, I kicked off my software engineering degree. During this journey, I crafted a web app with Flask and Angular, leveraging the Twitch API. I also built a Customer Relationship Management system using Spring.</p>

<p>At work, I handle everything from new projects to bug fixes, and I'm deeply interested in LLM models</p>

<p>When I’m not at the computer, you'll find me running or hanging out with my wife.</p>
